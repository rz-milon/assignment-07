      How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?

        <span>__</span> Concepts, like passing callbacks to functions or writing
        asynchronous code, are often not so difficult to implement, which makes
        most JavaScript developers care less about what goes on under the hood.
        They just donâ€™t care about understanding the complexities that have
        deeply abstracted from them by the language.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        As a JavaScript developer, it becomes increasingly important to
        understand what really happens under the hood and how most of these
        complexities abstracted from us really work. It helps us make more
        informed decisions, which can, in turn, boost our code performance
        drastically.
      </p>

      <p>
        This article focuses on one of the very important but seldom understood
        concepts or terms in JavaScript. The EVENT LOOP!.
      </p>

      <p>
        Writing asynchronous code can not be avoided in JavaScript, but why does
        a code running asynchronously really mean? i.e. The Event Loop

        Undefined
      </h2>
      <p>
        You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or
        method of an object
      </p>
      <p>
        Undefined is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an
        object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it.
        So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value.
      </p>
      <p>
        An undefined evaluates to false when used in conditional expression.
      </p>
      <p>An undefined value means lack of value.</p>
